Code description

This code solves the partial derriviatives equation:
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}
=
\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2}
+
\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial y^2}
+
f(x, y, t)

Where computational domain D is a square: 0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= y <= 1

Only Dirichlet boundary condition is supported



Compiling g++ [-Wall] -o serial.out



Exectuing variants:
1) Using default value for 'm'
   h = 1/m - spaitial step

   ./serial.out

2) Set 'm'=210 form command line
   ./serial 10
